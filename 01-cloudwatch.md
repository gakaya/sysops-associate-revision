# CloudWatch

## In Brief

* Used to measure things.
* Set up by default in lots of services.
* AWS services have default metrics (EC2 CPU usage, ELB latency etc.)
* Can set up any custom metrics via API (EC2 RAM, and completely custom "How many files named x?", "What is the price of a pint of milk?")

## Monitoring RDS

* RDS instances come with lots of metrics already set up.
  * Memory, CPU, Connections, Free Space, Network, IO, *Read/Write Latency*, lots more...

## Monitoring EBS
